#### Acknowledgments

First of all, I owe a serious debt to my wife, Ann, and my children, Deborah and Ryan. Their love and support made this book and all of the learning that preceded it possible. I'd also like to thank "Uncle Bob" Martin, president and founder of Object Mentor. His rigorous pragmatic approach to development and design, separating the critical from the inconsequential, gave me something to latch upon about 10 years ago, back when it seemed that I was about to drown in a wave of unrealistic advice. And thanks, Bob, for giving me the opportunity to see more code and work with more people over the past five years than I ever imagined possible.

> 首先，我欠我的妻子安和我的孩子黛博拉和瑞恩一大笔债。他们的爱和支持使这本书和之前的所有学习成为可能。我还要感谢 Object Mentor 的总裁兼创始人“Bob 叔叔”Martin。大约 10 年前，他对开发和设计采取了严谨务实的方法，将关键的与无关紧要的区分开来，这给了我一些可以抓住的东西，当时我似乎即将淹没在不切实际的建议浪潮中。感谢 Bob，在过去的五年里，让我有机会看到比我想象的更多的代码，与更多的人合作。

I also have to thank Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Ron Jeffries, and Ward Cunningham for offering me advice at times and teaching me a great deal about team work, design, and programming. Special thanks to all of the people who reviewed the drafts. The official reviewers were Sven Gorts, Robert C. Martin, Erik Meade, and Bill Wake; the unofficial reviewers were Dr. Robert Koss, James Grenning, Lowell Lindstrom, Micah Martin, Russ Rufer and the Silicon Valley Patterns Group, and James Newkirk.

> 我还要感谢 Kent Beck、Martin Fowler、Ron Jeffries 和 Ward Cunningham，他们有时会给我建议，教会我很多关于团队合作、设计和编程的知识。特别感谢所有审阅草稿的人。官方评审人是 Sven Gorts、Robert C.Martin、Erik Meade 和 Bill Wake；非官方评审人是 Robert Koss 博士、James Grenning、Lowell Lindstrom、Micah Martin、Russ Rufer 和硅谷模式小组，以及 James Newkirk。

Thanks also to reviewers of the very early drafts I placed on the Internet. Their feedback significantly affected the direction of the book after I reorganized its format. I apologize in advance to any of you I may have left out. The early reviewers were: Darren Hobbs, Martin Lippert, Keith Nicholas, Phlip Plumlee, C. Keith Ray, Robert Blum, Bill Burris, William Caputo, Brian Marick, Steve Freeman, David Putman, Emily Bache, Dave Astels, Russel Hill, Christian Sepulveda, and Brian Christopher Robinson.

> 也感谢我在互联网上发布的早期草稿的审稿人。他们的反馈在我重组了书的格式后，极大地影响了书的方向。我提前向我可能遗漏的任何人道歉。早期评审人有：达伦·霍布斯、马丁·利珀特、基思·尼古拉斯、Phlip Plumlee、C.基思·雷、罗伯特·布鲁姆、比尔·伯里斯、威廉·卡普托、布莱恩·马里克、史蒂夫·弗里曼、大卫·普特曼、艾米丽·巴切、戴夫·阿斯特尔斯、拉塞尔·希尔、克里斯蒂安·塞普尔维达和布莱恩·克里斯托弗·罗宾逊。

Thanks also to Joshua Kerievsky who gave a key early review and Jeff Langr who helped with advice and spot reviews all through the process.

> 还感谢约书亚·克里耶夫斯基（Joshua Kerievsky）和杰夫·兰格（Jeff Langr），前者提供了关键的早期评估，后者在整个过程中提供了建议和现场评估。

The reviewers helped me polish the draft considerably, but if there are errors remaining, they are solely mine.

> 审稿人帮我对草稿进行了相当大的润色，但如果还有错误，那都是我的错。

Thanks to Martin Fowler, Ralph Johnson, Bill Opdyke, Don Roberts, and John Brant for their work in the area of refactoring. It has been inspirational.

> 感谢 Martin Fowler、Ralph Johnson、Bill Opdyke、Don Roberts 和 John Brant 在重构领域所做的工作。这很鼓舞人心。

I also owe a special debt to Jay Packlick, Jacques Morel, and Kelly Mower of Sabre Holdings, and Graham Wright of Workshare Technology for their support and feedback.

> 我还特别感谢 Sabre Holdings 的 Jay Packlick、Jacques Morel 和 Kelly Mower，以及 Workshare Technology 的 Graham Wright，感谢他们的支持和反馈。

Special thanks also to Paul Petralia, Michelle Vincenti, Lori Lyons, Krista Hansing, and the rest of the team at Prentice-Hall. Thank you, Paul, for all of the help and encouragement that this first-time author needed.

> 特别感谢 Paul Petralia、Michelle Vincenti、Lori Lyons、Krista Hansing 和 Prentice Hall 团队的其他成员。保罗，谢谢你对这位第一次写作的作者的帮助和鼓励。

Special thanks also to Gary and Joan Feathers, April Roberts, Dr. Raimund Ege, David Lopez de Quintana, Carlos Perez, Carlos M. Rodriguez, and the late Dr. John C. Comfort for help and encouragement over the years. I also have to thank Brian Button for the example in Chapter 21, _I'm Changing the Same Code All Over the Place_. He wrote that code in about an hour when we were developing a refactoring course together, and it's become my favorite piece of teaching code.

> 特别感谢 Gary 和 Joan Feathers、April Roberts、Raimund Ege 博士、David Lopez de Quintana、Carlos Perez、Carlos M.Rodriguez 和已故的 John C.Comfort 博士多年来的帮助和鼓励。我还要感谢 Brian Button 在第 21 章中的例子，“我正在到处更改相同的代码”。当我们一起开发重构课程时，他用了大约一个小时就写下了这段代码，这已经成为我最喜欢的教学代码。

Also, special thanks to Janik Top, whose instrumental _De Futura_ served as the soundtrack for my last few weeks of work on this book.

> 此外，特别感谢 Janik Top，他的器乐《未来》为我最后几周的这本书配乐。

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone whom I've worked with over the past few years whose insights and challenges strengthened the material in this book.

> 最后，我要感谢在过去几年里与我共事的每一个人，他们的见解和挑战加强了本书的内容。
